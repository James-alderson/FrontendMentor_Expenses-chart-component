## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

### What I learned

In this project I learned to used `clamp()` and `calc()` css functions.
The `clamp()` CSS function clamps a value between an upper and lower bound. `clamp()` enables selecting a middle value within a range of values between a defined minimum and maximum. It takes three parameters: a minimum value, a preferred value, and a maximum allowed value.

The `calc()` CSS function lets you perform calculations when specifying CSS property values.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.card {
	width: clamp(300px, 340px, calc(100% - 1.8rem));
}
```

And after, I learned to used `forEach()` javaScript method.
The forEach() method executes a provided function once for each array element.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```js
config.data.datasets.forEach((datasetData) => {
  if (window.innerWidth >= 600) {
    datasetData.barThickness = 45
    datasetData.borderRadius = 6
  } else {
    datasetData.barThickness = 33
    datasetData.borderRadius = 4
  }
})
```
